# Developing Fulcio

Fulcio uses Go and can be run with no other dependencies, other than a GCP CA.

You can run locally (outside a container) with:

```
go run main.go serve --port 5555 --gcp_private_ca_parent=projects/<project>/locations/<location>/certificateAuthorities/<name>
```

where you fill in project, location and name for the `--gcp_private_ca_parent` flag

This can be any GCP SA that you have credentials to.
We use the default credential helpers so you can authenticate with Workload Identity in a cluster
or Application Default Credentials locally (remember to `gcloud application-default login`).

## Testing with the client

The client here is really only intended to test the `fulcio` server.

It can be run with:

```shell
go run ./cmd/client/
```

The client defaults to a local fulcio at http://127.0.0.1:5555.
This can be overridden with the `--fulcio_address` flag.

You should see your browser open, do the oauth dance and then some output like:

```shell
$ go run ./cmd/client/
Your browser will now be opened to:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=...

## Compose

Docker compose can be used to bring up the ct-log server for local testing.
This reuses the trillian components from Rekor.
Make sure you have github.com/sigsture/rekor cloned as well, and in the same
parent directory as `fulcio`.

You will first need to create a trillian tree for the ct_log to use, and place that
tree id in the `ctfe/ct_server.cfg` file.

Then you can bring it all up with:

```
docker-compose -f ../rekor/docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.yml
```

If it is all working, this should work:

```
ctclient -log_uri http://localhost:6962/test getroots
```

### Secrets

There are some test secrets in `ctfe` for DEVELOPMENT ONLY.
They were generated with:

```shell
openssl ec -in <(openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1) -out privkey.pem -des
openssl ec -in privkey.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem
```

The password was `foobar` and is stored in the ct_server.cfg file.
