# Fulcio

_A New Kind of Root CA For Code Signing_

fulcio is a free Root-CA for code signing certs - issuing certificates based on an OIDC email address.

fulcio only signs short-lived certificates that are valid for under 20 minutes.

## Status

Fulcio is a *work in progress*!

We're currently working hard on cutting a 1.0 release and productionizing the public instance.
We don't have a date yet, but follow along on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/sigstore/projects/5).

The fulcio root certificate running on our public instance (https://fulcio.sigstore.dev) can be obtained and verified against Sigstore's root (at the [sigstore/root-signing](https://github.com/sigstore/root-signing) repository). To do this, install and use [go-tuf](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf)'s CLI tools:
```
$ go get github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/cmd/tuf
$ go get github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/cmd/tuf-client
```

Then, obtain trusted root keys for Sigstore. This can be done from a checkout of the Sigstore's root signing repository at a trusted commit (e.g. after the livestreamed root signing ceremony).
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sigstore/root-signing
$ cd root-signing && git checkout 193343461a4d365ac517b5d668e01fbaddd4eba5
$ tuf -d ceremony/2021-06-18/ root-keys > sigstore-root.json
```

Initialize the TUF client with the previously obtained root keys and get the current Fulcio root certificate `fulcio_v1.crt.pem`.
```
$ tuf-client init https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigstore/root-signing/main/repository/repository/ sigstore-root.json
$ tuf-client get https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigstore/root-signing/main/repository/repository/ fulcio_v1.crt.pem

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

We **WILL** change this and add intermediaries in the future.

## API

The API is defined [here](./pkg/api/client.go).

## Transparency

Fulcio will publish issued certificates to a unique Certificate Transparency log (CT-log).
That log will be hosted by the sigstore project.

We encourage auditors to monitor this log, and aim to help people access the data.

A simple example would be a service that emails users (on a different address) when certficates have been issued on their behalf.
This can then be used to detect bad behavior or possible compromise.


## Security

Should you discover any security issues, please refer to sigstore's [security

## Info

`Fulcio` is developed as part of the [`sigstore`](https://sigstore.dev) project.
